I would use Djangos built-in authentication plus Groups & Permissions.
Each user belongs to a group Doctor Receptionist or Patient.
Each group has different permissions

User (default Django model)
PatientProfile : linked to a user
MedicalHistory : belongs to a patient
Appointment : belongs to a patient; can be created by receptionist

Doctor views: list all patients, view any medical history
Receptionist views: create appointments only
Patient views: see their own appointments + history
